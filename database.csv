Shay Hatten, John Wick: Chapter 4, Action, Film, ,"In New York City, John Wick prepares to exact his revenge against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the only individual above the High Table. Because of this, New York Continental Hotel manager Winston Scott and his concierge, Charon, are summoned to the Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a senior member of the High Table, who chastises Winston for his failure to assassinate John.[a]

To punish Winston, De Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, has the Continental destroyed, and executes Charon. He then travels to Paris and enlists Caine, a blind, retired High Table assassin and old friend of John's, to kill him, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise. John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, which is run by his friend Shimazu Koji. De Gramont's assassins, led by his right-hand man Chidi, arrive along with Caine to kill John. Akira, Koji's daughter and the hotel's concierge, orders the hotel evacuated and joins her father, John, and the hotel's staff in fighting off the High Table's assassins. Akira is wounded, while Koji tells John how to escape. On his way out, John fights off another wave of assassins, followed by Caine.

They are interrupted by a tracker pursuing John for a contract, nicknamed "Mr. Nobody" by de Gramont, but he lets John go after deciding the contract money is insufficient. Akira also escapes, but Koji is killed by Caine. John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests that John challenge De Gramont to a duel, as winning will free him of his obligation to the High Table. Per the Table's traditions, John can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family; seeing as he previously severed his ties to the Ruska Roma,[a] John travels to their headquarters in Berlin to receive a new crest marking his membership to the syndicate. His adoptive sister Katia agrees to do so in exchange for killing Killa, a German High Table senior who murdered her father.

John finds and kills Killa in his nightclub. Katia then brands John's arm with a Ruska Roma crest, enabling John to formally request a duel with de Gramont through Winston, who requests the New York Continental rebuilt with him reinstated as manager as part of his terms should John win. In Paris, John and de Gramont decide the parameters of their duel, in a meeting moderated by the Harbinger, the Table's emissary. De Gramont nominates a reluctant Caine to fight in his place. The duel is to take place the following sunrise at Sacré-Cœur; the Harbinger informs John that both he and Winston will be executed should he fail to appear on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a weapon and a new ballistic suit.

De Gramont attempts to prevent John from arriving to the duel by placing a $40 million contract on his head. John fights off hordes of assassins on his way to Sacré-Cœur, including Mr. Nobody, but the latter stops hunting John after he saves Mr. Nobody's dog from being killed by Chidi. Caine aids John in fighting his way up the stairs leading to the Sacré-Cœur; Chidi nearly kills John, but Mr. Nobody kills him first. John and Caine narrowly reach the summit in time to save Winston. The two duel with pistols; Caine gravely wounds John in the first three rounds. De Gramont asks to personally execute John for the final round, but John, who didn't fire his third round, shoots and kills de Gramont. The Harbinger declares him free of his debt to the High Table, but John dies peacefully due to his wounds.

After Winston is reinstated as manager of the Continental, he and the Bowery King attend John’s funeral, having buried him next to his late wife Helen. Sometime later, Caine comes home to reunite with his daughter, but is approached by the vengeful Akira.", 4/4, I have't read this yet.,2023-03-24,2023-04-12
